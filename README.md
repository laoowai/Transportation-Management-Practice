Chapter Overview

Outsourcing continues to grow in the second decade of the twenty-first century. Reliance on external experts for non-core services and capabilities is commonplace, as few organizations can afford to manage all business activities in-house. Transportation is another activity that is widely outsourced to external experts. Third party logistics service providers (3PLs) are experts in the management and flow of freight, allowing customers to focus their resources on other activities. Some of the larger 3PL organizations provide a one-stop shopping solution where customers can purchase all their transportation service needs, regardless of mode or geographic requirements.

Given the financial and service impact of transportation on a company’s success, developing an effective transportation outsourcing strategy is critical. It is imperative to find a 3PL with a track record of providing quality transportation management and services that support execution excellence. The chapter discusses the general structure of the 3PL industry, customer characteristics, and relationship options. Specific issues related to establishing and managing 3PL relationships are addressed, followed by a discussion of current and future 3PL industry issues. In the chapter, students will gain an understanding of the key benefits and challenges of outsourcing transportation requirements.




INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 

Given the expansive list of 3PL definitions, the introductory section of the chapter provides students with a broad interpretation of 3PL companies, that being: “an external supplier that performs all or part of a company’s logistics functions.” This encompasses suppliers of services such as inventory management, warehousing, distribution, financial services, and transportation, though this chapter focuses on the transportation aspects of the 3PL industry. Still, it is important to remind students that transportation services provided by a 3PL must be well integrated with the customer’s other logistical activities. 

Types of 3PL Providers

3PL segmentation can be based on the company’s ownership of tangible assets, facilities, and equipment. When a 3PL owns many or all of the assets necessary to run its customers’ transportation and logistics activities, they are known as asset based providers. When a 3PL contracts with other firms to provide transportation and logistics service rather than owning the required equipment and facilities, it is called a non-asset based provider. Students are much more likely to be familiar with asset based providers like UPS, FedEx, and other transportation based 3PLs. Thus, it is important to help them understand the concept of a non-asset based provider, its roles, and benefits. 

Also, most 3PLs have a core expertise in one or more logistics function. Thus, the initial segmentation of providers is based on functionality. 3PLs can be categorized as: transportation based, distribution based, forwarder based, financial based, or information based firms. Although some 3PLs may fit in more than one area, this discussion provides students with an idea of the scope of activities that may be outsourced. 

•	Transportation Based - These 3PLs trace their origins to freight movement via truck, rail, air, or other modes of transportation. As customer requirements expanded, these transportation companies developed 3PL subsidiaries or major divisions to provide a broader set of capabilities to serve the marketplace. 
•	Distribution Based - These 3PLs suppliers originated from the public or contract warehousing business and have expanded into a broader range of logistics services. Based on their traditional orientation, these types of organizations are heavily involved in logistics activities such as inventory management, warehousing, and order fulfillment. 
•	Forwarder Based - This group of 3PLs includes freight forwarders, brokers, and agents that primary facilitate the flow of goods on behalf of customers. These providers were discussed extensively in other chapters.
•	Financial Based - This category of 3PL providers helps customers with monetary issues and financial flows in the supply chain. Their traditional roles include freight rating, freight payment, freight bill auditing, and accounting services. 
•	Information Based - The Internet has provided an excellent platform for the growth of information based 3PLs. These companies have digitized many activities that were previously performed manually or required the use of licensed software. Today, these information based 3PLs provide logistics information systems, online freight brokerage services as well as cargo planning, routing, and scheduling. 

Within the transportation function, 3PLs provide four primary types of services: freight movement, freight management, intermediary services, and specialty services. Figure 12-2 highlights different services in each category and explanations are provided for 3PL services that are not discussed in other chapters of the textbook. The coverage includes traditional 3PL services, as well as some of the more unique capabilities and participants:

•	Surface freight forwarding  
•	Air freight forwarding 
•	Freight brokerage 
•	Intermodal marketing companies 
•	Shippers associations 
•	Dedicated contract carriage 
•	Drayage 
•	Pool distribution 
•	Merge in transit 
•	Last mile delivery 

The services section wraps up with a discussion of two key capabilities being developed by innovative 3PLs. First, they are developing integrated service offerings to accommodate customer desires for “one stop shopping” with a single service provider. Second, they are expanding service territories to meet the requirements of increasingly global customers.

3PL USER OVERVIEW

In the previous section, you were introduced to the different types of 3PLs and specific service providers, as well as brief references to 3PL customers. In this section, we dig into the customer aspects of 3PL. The key issues here include who these customers are, why they outsource transportation and logistics activities to 3PLs, and what services they require. As you will learn, outsourcing has become a way of life for shippers, who rely heavily on 3PLs to help plan, execute, and control their supply chains. 

The steady growth and expansion of the global 3PL industry produced 3PL revenues in 2015 of $788.4 billion. Looking at this figure, the 3PL industry in North America accounted for $195.5 billion, or 25 percent of the global total. This spending, in both the domestic and international markets, is driven by large companies. The 2017 Armstrong study found that 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies outsourced some or all of their logistics and supply chain functions, with technology, automotive, and retailing industries as leading users. Major 3PL users include companies such as General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart, with each using 50 or more 3PLs to help manage and operate their extensive supply chains. While many 3PLs rely on these Fortune 500 clients for current revenues, future growth opportunities also lie with small and midsize companies. 




Reasons for Outsourcing

While outsourcing is popular among companies with few internal transportation capabilities, 3PL services are also used by companies with world class supply chain capabilities. They use 3PLs when it is appropriate to reduce costs, increase resource capacity, and fill gaps in expertise. Both groups leverage the knowledge, skills, networks, and resources of experienced 3PLs rather than building or extending internal capabilities. 

Primary Activities Outsourced 

While the use of 3PLs has grown significantly, customer engagement patterns have not changed dramatically from year to year. Organizations predominantly use 3PL service providers for approximately three different services, led by transportation management as the most frequently used service, according to Armstrong and Associates. Their recent study of nearly 6,400 shipper-3PL relationships revealed that 81 percent remain “tactical” in nature, meaning 3PLs are mostly used for specific tasks such as transportation or warehousing. Only 19 percent of the relationships are classified as “strategic,” where a 3PL manages a customer’s entire logistics and supply chain operation on an integrated basis.

Results Achieved

The section wraps up with a discussion of customer perspectives regarding their 3PL relationships. Overall, 3PL users are satisfied with their outsourcing results, according to the Penn State-Capgemini study. The study participants, from across industries and around the globe, place a high value on their relationships with 3PL service providers and credit 3PLs with helping them to attain goals related to service, cost, and customer satisfaction. For the most recent year of the study, study participants report logistics cost reductions of 11 percent, inventory cost reduction of 6 percent, and fixed logistics asset reductions of 23 percent.


ESTABLISHING AND MANAGING 3PL RELATIONSHIPS 

The development of a 3PL relationship should involve significant planning and preparation. The development of a 3PL relationship should not happen by chance. A purchaser should carefully evaluate potential 3PL service providers and select the one whose capabilities, commitment level, and price match the buyer’s requirements. This can be a time consuming process but it will greatly increase the likelihood of a mutually beneficial relationship.
 
The chapter outlines a six-step process for selecting and managing 3PL partners:

•	 Step 1: Perform Strategic Assessment - The first stage involves the process by which the manufacturer becomes fully aware of its transportation and logistics needs and the overall strategies that will guide its operations.
•	Step 2: Decision to Form Relationship - The second stage focuses assessing internal competencies and weaknesses, in an effort to identify potential partners with strong capabilities that are needed by the customer.
•	Step 3: Evaluate Alternatives - Another key activity that requires significant attention is conducting thorough assessments of the capabilities of each 3PL under consideration. This should involve capability and capacity reviews, performance evaluations, and interviews. 
•	Step 4: Select Partners - While this stage is of critical concern to the customer, the selection of a transportation or logistics partner should be made only following very close consideration of the credentials of the top candidate 3PLs.
•	Step 5: Structure Operating Model - The fifth stage focuses on the “rules of engagement” and coordination of the 3PL relationship. This focuses on the activities, processes, and priorities that will be used to build and sustain the relationship.
•	Step 6: Implementation and Continuous Improvement - The ongoing step of the process is to continuously monitor and evaluate performance, seek out improvement opportunities, and sustain a mutually beneficial, long-term relationship. 

The ultimate goal of this six step process is to develop productive relationships between companies and 3PL service providers that create outstanding customer service and cost efficient operations. Like any relationships, both organizations must invest time and energy into its development and sustainment. Both parties must share information, trust their counterparts, and be open to new ideas and methods. The most successful, long term 3PL relationships occur when the organizations collaborate on a regular basis, adopt a team approach to problem solving, and leverage each other’s capabilities. 

STRATEGIC NEEDS OF 3PL USERS

The wrap-up section of this chapter discusses the strategic needs of 3PL users. Although the industry is poised for future growth, 3PLs must prepare for future challenges and growing customer requirements. The continuous change taking place in supply chains and the ongoing need for improved service and relationships means that 3PLs cannot be complacent. 

Although the 3PLs bear primary responsibility for providing these capabilities, the customers must take a collaborative role in achieving maximum success. Among the most important needs of 3PL users are strategic innovation, technological strength, capacity access, talent availability, omni-channel agility, and sustainability expertise. Among the most important needs of 3PL users are strategic innovation, technological strength, capacity access, talent availability, omni-channel agility, and sustainability expertise.

•	Strategic Innovation – to provide maximum value to the customer base, 3PLs must be innovative and collaborative in solutions development. Information sharing on changing requirements is essential for the two parties to understand the dynamics of the situation at hand. Then, the 3PL must have the willingness and capability to develop novel solutions. They also need to be more proactive in suggesting strategic solutions. 
•	Technological Strength – customers view technology as a critical capability of 3PL service providers to improve order management, cross-chain communication, enhance shipment visibility and event management, and manage day-to-day transportation operations. This need for strong, integrated technology capabilities from their service providers is essential for proactive control of freight as it moves across global supply chains. 
•	Capacity Access – when domestic and global economies are strong; the market for transportation services becomes very competitive. A solution to the capacity dilemma is to work with 3PL service providers such as freight forwarders and brokers that have ongoing relationships with multiple carriers. The combined volume of the 3PL’s customer base can be leveraged for consistent access to much needed capacity at competitive rates.
•	Talent Availability – at a time when SCM is gaining stature as a strategic driver of success, many organizations face a critical supply chain talent void due to years of headcount reduction, training budget cuts, and the retirement of highly skilled individuals. One way to address the talent crisis is to hire a 3PL with strong and stable talent. Top 3PLs have the strategic foresight to invest in training, development, and retention programs that help them maintain a strong pipeline of leaders who can diagnose customer needs, develop effective solutions, and manage the implementation process.
•	Omni-channel Agility – the emergence of new distribution channels has created a much more complex working environment for transportation and logistics managers, particularly for retailers. These customers desire to work with 3PLs that can effectively handle a growing inventory base and e-commerce orders that vary in type, size, and delivery location. 3PLs must offer flexible solutions for rapidly moving inventory through these networks to customer and managing returns from customers.  
•	Sustainability Expertise – the execution of supply chain processes has a significant impact on the environment – delivery processes require heavy use refined oil products, generate carbon emissions, and contribute to congestion. 3PL users need to work with service providers that are committed to sustainable supply chain practices and have developed expertise over time.

To maintain pace with customers’ future requirements, 3PLs will need to effectively expand their capabilities through internal growth, mergers, and strategic acquisition of competitors. As customers shift production from far away locations to nearby emerging markets where the cost of labor, shipping, and land is less expensive, 3PLs will need to establish a presence in these new regions. 3PLs will also need to enhance their breadth of capabilities and strategic services to serve customer desires for one stop shopping and lead logistics provider skills. Finally, 3PLs will need to be a driving force of transportation and logistics innovation to ensure that they can meet the cost-efficiency and service quality requirements of customers.

Study Questions

1.	Define the concepts of outsourcing and third party logistics. What role does transportation play in 3PL?

Outsourcing is an arrangement in which one company provides services for another company that could also be or usually have been provided in-house. A 3PL firm may be defined as “an external supplier that performs all or part of a company’s logistics functions.” These functions may include: inventory management, warehousing, distribution, financial services, and transportation. 

Transportation is one of the most widely outsourced logistics activities. The 2013 Penn State-Capgemini annual study of 3PL customers, found that half of the most frequently outsourced activities are related to the movement and management of freight. Hence, 3PL firms offer a wide array of transportation-related movement, management, intermediary, and special service capabilities as Figure 12-2 in the chapter reveals. 

2.	What are the basic types of 3PL firms? How do they facilitate the planning and execution of freight transportation?

•	Transportation Based - These 3PLs trace their origins to freight movement via truck, rail, air, or other modes of transportation. As customer requirements expanded, these transportation companies developed 3PL subsidiaries or major divisions to provide a broader set of capabilities to serve the marketplace. 
•	Distribution Based - These 3PLs suppliers originated from the public or contract warehousing business and have expanded into a broader range of logistics services. Based on their traditional orientation, these types of organizations are heavily involved in logistics activities such as inventory management, warehousing, and order fulfillment. 
•	Forwarder Based - This group of 3PLs includes freight forwarders, brokers, and agents that primary facilitate the flow of goods on behalf of customers. 
•	Financial Based - This category of 3PL providers helps customers with monetary issues and financial flows in the supply chain. Their traditional roles include freight rating, freight payment, freight bill auditing, and accounting services. 
•	Information Based - The Internet has provided an excellent platform for the growth of information based 3PLs. These companies have digitized many activities that were previously performed manually or required the use of licensed software. Today, these information based 3PLs provide logistics information systems, online freight brokerage services as well as cargo planning, routing, and scheduling. 

3.	Why would a company use an asset based 3PL service provider versus a non-asset based provider?

Reasons for using asset based service providers: Many customers choose to work with asset based providers because they have readily available capacity, permanent employees, and direct control of the customers’ freight. They prefer to work with a single 3PL who will take total responsibility for the outsourced activity and assume accountability if problems occur. Customers can also maintain greater visibility of outsourced activities and inventory if they are handled by a technology savvy asset based provider who performs all activities internally rather than handing them off to other companies. 

Reasons for using non-asset based service providers: Customers view non-asset based providers as being more flexible than their asset based counterparts. Non-asset based 3PLs can be unbiased in their decision making as they are not limited to an internal infrastructure of assets. Because they are not restricted to using any particular transportation company or set of facilities to serve customers, they are free to objectively choose the best set of service providers and create innovative solutions for customers. This can lead to tailored services and lower overall costs for the customer.



4.	Discuss the four primary types of transportation services offered by 3PL service providers. 

Within the transportation function, 3PLs provide four primary types of services: freight movement, freight management, intermediary services, and specialty services. 

Figure 12-2 highlights different services in each category and explanations are provided for 3PL services that are not discussed in other chapters of the textbook.


5.	Why is service integration an important issue to the 3PL industry? What companies are developing these capabilities?

As customers embrace global sourcing and distribution, their supply chains become more complex and challenging. In turn, they need the assistance of highly capable 3PLs to develop integrated, cross-functional global supply chains. Transportation expertise is not enough to capture the attention of these increasingly sophisticated customers. 3PLs must also develop expertise in supply chain network design, process implementation and coordination, and day-to-day execution. Doing all three requires strong IT tools, multi-modal capabilities, and the ability to manage and streamline the flow of goods through the supply chain. 

In response to the demand for integrated services, larger 3PLs have embarked on an aggressive plan to expand and integrate their capabilities. Others are bolstering their integration capabilities and their international resources through the creation of internal divisions, acquisition of smaller 3PLs, or the development of partner relationships with other 3PLs. 

6.	What are some of the more frequently outsourced logistics activities? Less frequently outsourced?

While the use of 3PLs has grown dramatically, customer engagement patterns have not changed dramatically from year to year. 3PL services are widely "tactical" in nature, meaning 3PLs are used for specific tasks such as transportation or warehousing. These tactical services often focus on transportation as highlighted by Table 12-5 in the Chapter. The 2013 Penn State-Capgemini study found that the most frequently outsourced activities are related to the movement and management of freight.

Far fewer companies engage in outsourcing at a strategic level where a 3PL essentially takes over a customer's entire logistics and supply chain operation. 

7.	To what extent are clients/customers satisfied with 3PL services? What can 3PLs do to improve customer satisfaction?

The 2014 Penn State – Capgemini study participants are satisfied with their outsourcing results. The study participants, from across industries and around the globe, place a high value on their relationships with 3PL service providers. A distinct majority of the users (90 percent) and 3PL service providers (97 percent) state that their relationships are successful. In addition, 55 percent of the users indicate that their use of 3PL services has led to year-over-year incremental benefits in order fill rates and accuracy. Also, study participants report logistics cost reductions of 11 percent, inventory cost reduction of 6 percent, and fixed logistics asset reductions of 23 percent.

Still, there is room for improvement. 3PLs can develop stronger technologies, retain top talent, and collaborate with customers to enhance their value proposition and customer satisfaction. 

8.	Describe the six steps involved in establishing and managing 3PL relationships. Which step(s) do you feel is (are) most critical?

Step 1: Perform Strategic Assessment - The first stage involves the process by which the manufacturer becomes fully aware of its transportation and logistics needs and the overall strategies that will guide its operations.

Step 2: Decision to Form Relationship - The second stage focuses assessing internal competencies and weaknesses, in an effort to identify potential partners with strong capabilities that are needed by the customer.

Step 3: Evaluate Alternatives - Another key activity that requires significant attention is conducting thorough assessments of the capabilities of each 3PL under consideration. This should involve capability and capacity reviews, performance evaluations, and interviews. 

Step 4: Select Partners - While this stage is of critical concern to the customer, the selection of a transportation or logistics partner should be made only following very close consideration of the credentials of the top candidate 3PLs.

Step 5: Structure Operating Model - The fifth stage focuses on the “rules of engagement” and coordination of the 3PL relationship. This focuses on the activities, processes, and priorities that will be used to build and sustain the relationship.

Step 6: Implementation and Continuous Improvement - The ongoing step of the process is to continuously monitor and evaluate performance, seek out improvement opportunities, and sustain a mutually beneficial, long-term relationship. 

The second part of the question is an opinion response. While every step contributes to the success of a 3PL relationship, selecting the right partners (#4) and managing 3PL performance (#6) are particularly important for achieving outstanding customer service and cost efficient operations.


9.	If you were given the task of outsourcing your company’s transportation operations, what types of capabilities would you seek in a 3PL service provider?

The specific list of required capabilities would depend upon the company’s goals, objectives, internal transportation capabilities, and capacity. That being said, key capabilities of 3PLs would include:
•	Expertise and significant experience in the desired transportation service functionality
•	Strong information technology capabilities 
•	Commitment to customer service and continuous performance improvement
•	Access to capacity and service coverage of required geographic regions
•	Financial stability and strong cash flow 
•	Efficient operations and competitive pricing
•	Compatible management style and philosophy / cultural fit
 
10.	After implementing a 3PL relationship, how should transportation managers promote continuous improvement of performance and achieve supply chain value?

The future success of a 3PL relationship will be a direct function of the ability of the involved organizations to achieve both continuous and breakthrough improvement. As indicated in Figure 12-6, there are a number of steps that should be considered in the continuous improvement process. In addition, efforts should be made to create breakthrough improvements that drive the relationship to new levels of competitive advantage.

11.	Discuss the strategic needs and challenges that transportation managers face. How can 3PL service providers help them improve performance and reduce costs?

The continuous change taking place in supply chains and the ongoing need for improved service and relationships means that 3PLs cannot be complacent. Among the most important needs of 3PL users are strategic innovation, technological strength, capacity access, talent availability, omni-channel agility, and sustainability expertise. 
Figure 12-7 highlights additional capabilities needed by 3PL users to keep pace with the competition. Although the 3PLs bear primary responsibility for providing these capabilities, the customers must take a collaborative role in achieving maximum success. 

12.	Why is information technology an important issue to customers when outsourcing transportation and logistics activities? 

IT is a high priority issue for 3PL customers and they should scrutinize the current IT capabilities and future IT investment plans of potential service providers during the 3PL selection process. Technology is viewed as a critical capability of 3PL service providers to improve communication, enhance shipment visibility and event management, and manage day-to-day transportation operations, according to the Penn State – Capgemini study. More than 92 percent of the study participants view IT capabilities as a necessary element of a 3PL service offering. However, only 35 percent report that they are satisfied with their 3PL service providers’ IT capabilities, continuing a gap between expectations and performance that has lingered for more than seven years.

3PLs will need to improve their abilities to provide shipment visibility and their integration among internal systems to support this customer requirement. Without them, it is difficult for customers to achieve seamless information flows across their transportation and logistics networks. On the 3PL side, the lack of IT integration hampers their ability to coordinate internal activities, offer true integrated service capabilities, or effectively serve as a lead logistics provider. 

13. What are the six issues customers must deal with if they choose to use private carriage (instead of 3PLs)? 

- Operating cost
- Equipment
- Leasing
- Organization
- Control
- Regulations


Case Questions

CASE 12–1 Jetstream Aerospace

1.	Discuss the pros and cons of using third party logistics for Jetstream’s aftermarket services. 

Table 12-3 in the textbook effectively highlights the pros and cons of outsourcing Jetstream’s aftermarket service operations. 

Pros: Jetstream may be able to leverage the expertise of a 3PL for reduced service costs and improved customer service, using a 3PL will allow Jetstream to focus its efforts on manufacturing and new product delivery rather than service parts logistics, and the 3PL may be able to leverage existing facilities to extend the Jetstream service parts network without the company needing to invest in aftermarket service facilities. In short, Jetstream could create a service parts network that is better, faster, and cheaper than what could be achieved in house if they strategically choose a quality service provider. 

There are potential drawbacks to 3PL use, particularly if Jetstream does a poor job of defining their needs and/or makes a poor choice of 3PL provider. Control could be lost, promised cost savings may not materialize, service levels may not improve, visibility of orders could be reduced, and essential customer relationships could be weakened by the introduction of a 3PL that fails to perform as promised. 

2.	What potential risks exist with outsourcing the aftermarket services to a 3PL?

The primary risk in this scenario is a loss of control over the aftermarket services. If Jetstream outsources the replacement parts supply chain and fails to monitor 3PL performance, they are wholly dependent upon the 3PL to effectively serve the customers. Poor service performance will tarnish Jetstream’s image among customers, rather than the 3PL’s image. Also, by outsourcing these key functions, Jetstream may lose internal expertise and critical knowledge about transportation and logistics. Finally, cost control may be an issue that arises.
 
3.	What transportation and logistics activities should be considered for outsourcing in this situation? Should Jetstream obtain these services on a tactical or strategic basis? 

Given the problems identified by the executives, Jetstream should seek out a 3PL or service provider or consortium of 3PLs with an extensive and integrated set of capabilities:

•	Expedited delivery service
•	Warehousing and fulfillment services
•	Inventory management
•	Order management and customer service

Given the time sensitivity of the situation and the need to maintain order visibility, it would make the most sense to obtain these services on a strategic basis from a single, highly capable 3PL. If Jetstream insists on managing the aftermarket services internally, they will need to coordinate activities closely with tactical delivery service providers to ensure that customers don’t experience delays or visibility gaps. 
 
4.	What type of 3PL service provider is best suited to meet Jetstream’s aftermarket service goals? How should they go about finding a capable 3PL service provider?

The most logical choice here is an integrated 3PL that has both transportation and distribution capabilities. The 3PL needs to be able to strategically manage inventory, have system-wide visibility, fulfill orders within a short window, and deliver service parts in a very quick fashion. It would not be beneficial to Jetstream or its customers to distribute these roles among multiple firms. 

Jetstream should meticulously follow the six step process outlined in the chapter to (1) determine if their needs can be adequately met by a 3PL service integrator, and (2) establish a relationship with a qualified, service-oriented 3PL that has experience in service parts management on a global basis. This process would likely lead Jetstream to companies like FedEx, UPS, Exel, or some other global 3PL company that understands the aftermarket customer service side of business. 

CASE 12–2 Closet Concepts Ltd. 

1.	What role can third party logistics play in the CCL e-commerce initiative? Is it a viable alternative to Sheahan’s private fleet/pool distribution strategy??

A 3PL provider could handle all or part of the CCL e-commerce initiative. Order fulfillment is often handled by 3PLs on behalf of small sellers or those who wish to focus their internal capabilities on larger customers. On the transportation side, a 3PL could offer last mile delivery services. Innovative 3PLs in this market space cover the final dock-to-door or store-to-door delivery and provide value-added services such as inside delivery, product assembly, installation, and testing, and packaging removal. This would preserve the capacity of CCL’s private fleet for delivery of higher end products to distributors. 

2.	What type of 3PL service provider is best suited to serve the CCL e-commerce customers? Why?

If only delivery services are needed, then a transportation based service provider that is experienced with the movement and final delivery of furniture products is logical. This will help cut down on damage and other customer service problems. Specifically, an asset based 3PL with expertise in regional transportation would be most beneficial for CCL.

3.	Should Howard and Tatar consider the use of an integrated 3PL? Why or why not? not?

If both fulfillment and delivery services are required, it would be logical to consider using an integrated service provider with a comprehensive range of logistical capabilities. The use of an integrator that can store product, fill customer orders, and deliver them in a timely, defect-free fashion is worth considering. 

4.	If CCL decided to add installation services to its e-commerce initiatives, what types of 3PL service provider should be used? Why?

The primary service provider would be a specialist in last mile delivery. These last mile service providers represent the final opportunity to impress customers and provide a high quality delivery experience. Retailers like Macy’s, eBay, and Amazon provide a wide array of last mile services including same day delivery in an attempt to differentiate themselves from the competition. 


SUGGESTED INTERNET PROJECT

 
Assign teams of students a 3PL company and ask the team to create a presentation about the company. Students should be required to use multiple sources of information (more than just the company website) in their research.
